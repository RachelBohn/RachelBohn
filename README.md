### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸŒ± About me:

Currently doing a Web Development bootcamp with HyperionDev until end of March 2023, I am learning new skills such as :
* **HTML**
* **CSS**
* **Javascript**
* **Node JS**
* **React**
* **MongoDB**

Having a background in UX Research, I'm looking for combining the UX skills that I've acquired with the ones I'm acquiring at the present time.

## ðŸ”­  My projects:

I regularly add new projects in my GitHub repositories that I'm currently working on or have worked on during my bootcamp. 

I've recently added a project involving a website where users can find sweet recipes and save them for later. I'll keep working on that project to improve it and add new functionalities.

If you're a food lover, feel free to have a look at it :)
